#  HTML & CSS: Responsywność (RWD)
My challenge was to build out this responsive layout and get it looking as close to the design as possible. I tested my responcive css skills.   

**Main features**:
- Add email and submit the form;
- See a success message with email after successfully submitting the form;
- See form validation messages if:
  The field is left empty
  The email address is not formatted correctly
