#  HTML & CSS: Responsywność (RWD)
My challenge was to build out this responsive layout and get it looking as close to the design as possible. I tested my responcive css skills.   

**Main features**:
 1. **Flexible Layouts**

## 3. **Responsive Images and Multimedia**

   - **Description:** Adapting images and multimedia for different screens to optimize page loading times.
